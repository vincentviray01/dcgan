Creating Anime faces with DCGAN

This is a project where I used a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network to generate pictures of anime faces. 
This network was trained on a datast of 63,569 images of size 128x128 pixels.

The network has 1,050,112 trainable parameters using Convolution, Transposed Convolution, Dropout, Dense, and BatchNorm layers with ReLU and TanH activations.

The model was currently trained for about 20 hours over 1,000 epochs on a RTX 2060 GPU.
